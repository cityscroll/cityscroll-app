# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.


## PASSPort Public machine path

PASSPort Public has **no Socrata dataset** for contracts/RFx. Stable machine dumps:

- `https://a0333-passportpublic.nyc.gov/dataJs/contractData.js` (`public_ctr_data`)
- `https://a0333-passportpublic.nyc.gov/dataJs/rfxData.js` (`public_rfx_data`)

Edge materialization: `worker/src/passport.mjs` → D1 `passport_contracts` / `passport_rfx`.
Strict EPIN↔PIN join: `worker/src/lib/passport_join.mjs`. Measured rates live in
`site/data/source_contracts.json` (`join_measurement`) and
`site/data/passport_sources/verification_receipts/`.

## Bid Tabulations Historical (`9k82-ys7w`)

Ranked class-(a) bid-count source. **Measured below usefulness** (2026-07-30): strict
PIN↔`bid_number` join is **0%** on Procurement notices since 2025-01-01 and **9.07%** on
2016–2021 overlap (no PIN column; openings end 2021-03-24). Source contract
`bid-tabulations-historical` is **disabled** — no edge materialization. Strategies and
receipts: `worker/src/lib/bid_tabulations_join.mjs`,
`site/data/bid_tabulation_sources/`.

## Content and testing — lifecycle gap taxonomy

**Standing contract:** every absent-data state on a lifecycle surface must tell the reader *which kind of gap* it is. Never ship an undifferentiated “no record” / “unknown” / blank slot when the product has decided a field is missing.

| Class | Reader-facing register | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Not yet ingested** | “Not yet shown here — … live in *source*.” | A public source publishes this field; the empty slot is incomplete join or a missing adapter. Name the source. |
| **Not published** | “The city does not publish this — it would appear in *where* if released.” | No public, joinable release is known. Name the logical home when one exists. |

Keep **per-item** specificity (pending vs registered vs payments; subsidy outcome vs company field; Council vote vs matter). No page-level disclaimer in place of a slot-level line.

**Out of taxonomy (keep operational wording):** source unreachable (`lifecycle_unknown_html`, `subsidy_source_unavailable_html`) and multi-match ambiguity (`lifecycle_ambiguous_html`).

**Where it lives**

- Machine inventory + ranked class-(a) ingest list: [`site/data/gap_taxonomy.json`](site/data/gap_taxonomy.json)
- Human report: [`docs/gap-taxonomy.md`](docs/gap-taxonomy.md)
- Characterization (both registers, real field cases): `node --test test/gap_taxonomy.test.mjs`
- Screenshot capture: `python3 tools/capture_gap_taxonomy.py`

When adding a new lifecycle empty state: pick class a or b with evidence, add or update the inventory row, use the matching register in English and all shipping locales, and extend the characterization test. Prefer pointing new work at the inventory over inventing a third gap register.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
